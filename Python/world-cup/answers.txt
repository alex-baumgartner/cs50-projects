Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

That the team with the highest rating has the highest chance of winning - it seems that the matchup configuration also plays into the chance of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

The predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
